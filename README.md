# RetailManagement
  The prototype has been designed on the computer using java on eclipse IDE 
  *although* not super polished it allows for code reusability when it comes to create the actual target prototype.
  
## Requirement
* System has the ability to look for the product from the stock in line with clients demand. 
* System has the ability to add stock.
* System has the capacity to update stock. 
* System has the capacity to delete stock. 
* System has the capacity to reveal the stock report.
* System has the capacity to portray the sales report. 
* System has the ability to view every service record consistent with the product specific
ID. 

## Running the prototype

The prototype is run from the Eclipse Java IDE to yield the interfaces. 
To start, Make sure youhave a JRE system library, make sure you have all the jar files in the JRE system library, right
click on `src` folder in the folder holding the code files of the prototype then lastly chose Run as `1 Java Application` to have it running.

## Summary of the prototype

The design of the retail management system follows a desktop-based approach in which each function few number of
steps to help users to easily learn and operate the system. The prototype has been individually
evaluated to informally analyze its usability. Since most people have an ability to use computers
but not necessarily computer literate, there is a need for simplicity and for interface not to be
involving complex operation steps. In hindsight, this type of evaluation would have been useful,
given that this system will be designed to be implemented in a real world working environment.
The quality design has the following characteristics: 
* Standards and procedures. Standards institute the necessities, and procedures give the
information on the manner they are applied to a given course. Jointly they present
structure for the conjunction of instructions and requirements. 
* Organization, skills, and resources. The system has been designed to suit any
organization’s structure, its personnel’s’ skills, and the available resources to ensure its
continued operation.

The system works well wholly allowing navigating across interfaces, however, some little
improvements such as adding forward and back buttons and deleting records feature. The system
has enhanced usability since it follows the schneidermans’ rules: 
* Strive for consistency. The menus are constantly and clearly visible.
* Offer informative feedback. Errors are rectified in the form parts of the application. For
example, if one makes letters entry in the price field a warning is flagged. 
* Permit easy reversal of actions. The user can choose to go back to any previous interface
from any. The system however, does not allow a user to however skip an interface during
the process of item stock management. 
* Allowing internal control locus. The system is designed to be user centered as the
initiator of actions.

The system would work well and efficiently for identified users and tasks since it fully functional
and it offers the following advantages: 
* Timeliness - Faster processing of inventory records reduces waiting time making this
process very quick and efficient.
* Accuracy and security of information kept about inventory and business processes -
system is secured via log in authentication hence only authorized users can access it. 
* Management of stock - The system is designed to allow linking into an inventory system
hence give up to date information about pricing, stock levels and order phenomena hence
making it well suited to the inventory and stock management.
